## Criteria

Excellent work will include:

* Clean, well-written, effective code
* Version control in Git
* Clear documentation of how te code works
* A presentation of the game and of the process of creating it
* Citations (MLA format) of the resources you used.

## Expectations

### General

* This is intended as an individual project. You may help each other, but you are responsible for your own work.
* I am willing to consider partnerships for larger and more complex projects
* You may (and are encouraged to) use resources you find online, but may not outright copy someone else's work and must credit your sources
* Your work should challenge you but be achievable
* You are expected to understand how your own code works. If you are not able to explain any part of your own code, that will be cause for concern

### Code

* Your code should make effective use of classes and/or functions. We will review in class
* Your code should be clear and well documented with comments and appropriate naming schemes
* Your code should be managed through Git. I will be expecting to see commits reflecting your progress as you work on the project, and would prefer to see feature branches and a stable master branch.
* Your code should be as reliable and as free of bugs as you can manage
